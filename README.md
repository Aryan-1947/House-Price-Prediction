# House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the sale price of houses using historical data and machine learning regression models.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Contains features such as:
  - LotArea, YearBuilt, OverallQual, TotalBsmtSF, GrLivArea, etc.
- Target: `SalePrice`

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Handle missing data & preprocess
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature engineering
5. Train-test split
6. Train & evaluate regression models

## 📈 Results
Discuss the best performing model and what metric improvements mean.

## 🖼️ Visualizations
Include plots (e.g., Actual vs Predicted, Correlation heatmap, Residual plots).
